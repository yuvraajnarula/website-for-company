			<font id="idea2"> “You're incredibly, absolutely, extremely, supremely, unbelievably different.” </font><br>
			<p class="app1"> Our App has very low system requirements. It can be installed on Android (4 and above), Windows (XP and above) and on most Linux systems, and we are planning to launch it on Apple devices soon.  Our app also consumes very low bandwidth , for an hour of a video call, it consumes only 0.3gb as compared to 1gb on another competitor . Recently, governments around the world have declared one of our competitors  as unsafe. To help avoid this issue, our team has implemented 256-bit encryption which is one of the safest encryption invented till date. These features make our software one of the best apps out there ! </p>
