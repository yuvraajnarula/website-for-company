                <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>
              <p class="eclipse">
              According to World Health Organisation(WHO), coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
          
          Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
          
          The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
          
          The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
          
          At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.

               <h1><br>The Pandemic of COVID-19</h1>
               <p><br>The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. The pandemic is moving like a wave—one that may yet crash on those least able to cope.
          
               But COVID-19 is much more than a health crisis. By stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political crises that will leave deep scars.
          
               Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 25 million jobs could be lost.  </p>

                <h1><br>How can Social Distancing help in prevention of COVID-19?</h1>
               <p><br>Social distancing includes ways to stop or slow the spread of infectious diseases. It means less contact between you and other people.
                Social distancing is important because COVID-19 is most likely to spread from person-to-person
                through: 
                <ol type="i">
                  <li> Direct close contact with a person while they are infectious or in the 24 hours before their
                   symptoms appeared.  </li><br>
                   <li> Close contact with a person with a confirmed infection who coughs or sneezes, or </li><br>
                   <li>touching objects or surfaces (such as door handles or tables) contaminated from a cough
                    or sneeze from a person with a confirmed infection, and then touching your mouth or
                    face.</li></ol>   <br>
                   So, the more space between you and others, the harder it is for the virus to spread.</p>

             <p>
              The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends people should keep at least 1 metre away from each other to protect against coronavirus. This kind of social distancing, together with regular handwashing, is key in efforts to halt the spread of COVID-19.

             <p>
               Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific and medical radio bands, from 2. 400 to 2. 485 GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs). The Bluetooth Core Specification mandates a range of not less than 10 metres (33 ft), but there is no upper limit on actual range.
